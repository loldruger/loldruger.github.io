                            Using Java Spring, Hibernate, QueryDSL, Oracle 19c, I participated in developing a web backend API for a 3D furniture placement simulator.
                            I worked with in advance thoroughly understanding the implementation of JPA layer, Knowledge of OS and Network. Based on it, I enhanced the quality of the code.
                            I worked on many core features of the project such as leveraging DB connection pool, managing multithreaded spring scheduler and implementing a FTPS server. Additionally, I wrote a batch file to migrate the database to another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even I helped the front-end team to optimize the performance of the web application by analyzing the app's memory leakage and performance bottleneck using Browser DevTools.
                            I integrated this project's development environment with Windows WSL2 and Java backend and React frontend. 
                        </p>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <div class="title">2. Developed a iOS Financial and Community Service App</div>
                    <div class="date">2021-02 ~ 2021-04</div>

                            I was assigned urgently this project because this due date was so tight. But I was quickly able to adapt to the project. And although seriously super unstable and each-time-changing API protocol made this project harder to develop,
                            I wrote UI components flexibly as much as possible so that whenever the API changes, I could just change the API layer only. At that time, SwiftUI/iOS13 didn't support many of the UI components, so I had to implement them by hand.
                            So I made some custom UI components "Pull to Refresh" and "Infinite Scroll", "Wrap Around Container", "Universal Grid View". I leveraged Swift with its Protocol oriented programming and limited extension usage for this project to make the code more readable and maintainable.
                            I needed to finish this project in 2 months, I had to work on the project literally 24/7. I was so exhausted but I was able to finish the project on time.

                    <div class="title">1. Developed Web Based Writing Service integrated with SNS</div>
                    <div class="date">2021-01 ~ 2021-08</div>
                    <div class="content" from="2021-01" to="2021-08">
                        <p>
                            With bunch of stacks such as Vue, Vuex, Vuex-pathify, Vuetify, Apollo Client&Server, GraphQL, Objection.js, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, I solely developed a web based writing service integrated with SNS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was two months to understand the whole structure of the project and the code base. I had to learn a lot of new stacks I listed above.
                            After understanding, I re-architected the relational database schema for the quite complex tables due to the nature of the SNS service because the original schema was Wiki based.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Again, I separated the backend layer into a couple of layers: Business Logic Layer, Bridge Layer, and Endpoint Layer. I was responsible for this project to develop the backend API and the frontend UI.
                            This project really needed to be clarified to configure the development environment. So I documented and wrote instructions for setup and deployment. I chose ultimately to use WSL for the development environment.
                            And VSCode as the IDE for remote browser debugging and remote server debugging. It required some powershell scripts to IP table configuration and port forwarding.

                        I was responsible for writing the device installation status reporting docs. It was originally a job to be done by hand, but I automated it using Google Spreadsheet and Google Apps Script.
                        It even automatically sent the report to my boss's email. So this greatly improved the workflow and reduced the time to write the report.

                <div class="title">3. Modeled Mathematically and Developed many kinds of sensors abstracted module</div>
                <div class="date">2018-07 ~ 2019-05</div>
                <div class="content" from="2018-07" to="2019-05">
                    <p>
                        I modeled a mathematical model of the sensors which were written in the firmware literally in the form of a table, to just only one line of 2nd order polynomial function which approximates the trend of the real data. 
                        This work made the bunch of codes to be removed and the firmware to be more readable and maintainable. And I mocked interface concept to the sensors objects to be more abstracted and flexible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, I developed a driver for many custom 8-seg displays. It was designed and developed to have a universal API to be able to replace the display module easily.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="title">2. Developed a Driver which interfaces with Lora Transmission Module</div>

                <div class="content" from="2018-10" to="2018-12">
                    <p>
                        To attach remote control functionality to the firmware I developed, I worked to implement a driver interface for a Lora transmission module using ANSI C.
                        There could be a chance that I could control a device directly or use remote control simultaneously, so I had to adopt a simple mutex concept to prevent data races or corruption.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        By the limitation of the Lora technology, it could transmit only about 60 bits of serialized data at once. So I had to implement a generic bitwise deserialization parser. It was so well designed that it could be used in other projects as well.
                        Also I needed to satisfy the requirement of the Lora module protocol which is confliction avoidance stratgey.
                    </P>
                </div>
                <div class="title">1. Developed an Automated Control Firmware for Industrial Refrigeration</div>
                <div class="date">2018-07 ~ 2019-03</div>
                <div class="content" from="2018-07" to="2019-03">
                    <p>
                        Using ANSI C, I was solely assigned to the main project to develop a firmware which required to control industrial refrigeration systems and to provide an ergonomic user experience.
                        This project required me a lot of research such as understanding data sheet of the components, understanding the refrigeration system etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because this device would be running 24/7, I was responsible for the stability of the firmware. It must be considered accumulated errors and any memory leak.
                        That's why I architected the firmware more abstractly and modularly. for example, I segregated the firmware into 3 layers: Business Logic Layer(Application Layer), Bridge Layer, and Hardware Abstraction Layer(integrated with HAL).

This action may block the path, but the path will make a detour around the Moai tower the user placed. This simple mechanism and the unique Moai concept spread rapidly through many personal media channels. This resulted in our achieving the top spot in Strategy Game Popularity Rankings for a long time.
